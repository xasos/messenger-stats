# messenger-wordcloud
messenger-wordcloud was inspired by [fb-chat-wordcloud](https://github.com/jpnelson/fb-chat-wordcloud), a Java library to generate wordclouds from FB Messenger messages.

## Setup 
 - Navigate to [Download Your Information](https://www.facebook.com/dyi) on Facebook. Click on "Download a copy of your Facebook data."
 - After FB emails you a link to a zip file, unzip the archive, and copy `html/messages.htm` into the root directory of this cloned repo.
 - Then, run `python app.py` and you're all set! A wordcloud and stats will be generated from your messages. This process may take a few minutes.
